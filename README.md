# DisDel
Discord dm/server message deleter made in Go.

## Usage
- `.del [amount]`
  - `.del 10` - Deletes 10 messages (Counts other users)

- `.del`
  - Deletes messages until none left (Counts other users)

### Notes
- I'm not resposible for how you use this/anything that happens.
- This counts as selfbotting which is against tos.
- Don't use around people unless they don't snitch.
- Don't be obvious, e.g do not delete 1k messages in under 10 minutes (If possible, just don't).
- Delays are there to avoid detection.
